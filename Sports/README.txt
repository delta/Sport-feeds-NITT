APP's Workflow:

The app has to be built on the given stack.
This app is more about profile management and its dynamic nature as front-end.
Step 1-> There would be an admin panel which would initially add Teams to the account
         and give accessKey to superUser of any sport.
Step 2.-> The index page should have a very good interface with all teams of college and
          a dashboard to login. COme up with more funtionalities idea.
Step 3.-> Team's superuser can login. Once he log's in he goes to his home.p     
          hp page. This home.php would have editable feature. Front end is crucial here.

Step 4. -> Think of advance and efficient editing. SO that user
          would love editing.
Step 5. ->Decide what all custom fields you want to 
          give for editable home page.
Step 6. ->You may need to deploy some editor and image canvassing.


Coding Practices:

*All of you have to first go through the given base code stack i.e prtotype.
*Your work should be very small small module based.
*Divide the work among you.
*Every1 should be able to sync with every1's code.
*Every 2nd day code has to be merged to original stack from ur local system.
*Javascript(oop),php(oop),jquery,ajax,socket.io,node,css are must to be grapsed strongly.
*efficiency is must.
*Put images to be lazy loading. Think of some algorithm to implement lazy loading on browser.

Database Schema:
Now the app has a simple one table.
Decide the schema for editing and stuffs functionalities.
