#Installation:
<br>
1.Linux destro is must.<br>
2.Go to /var/www folder and paste this folder there.<br>
3.open /core/connect/database.php and change db username and password.<br>
4.import Sport-feeds-NITT as your db.<br>
5.Run localhost/Sports (Make sure project directory is chmod with all permissions.)
<br><br>



#APP's Workflow:
<br>
The app has to be built on the given stack.<br>
This app is more about profile management and its dynamic nature as front-end.<br>
Step 1-> There would be an admin panel which would initially add Teams to the account
         and give accessKey to superUser of any sport.<br>
Step 2.-> The index page should have a very good interface with all teams of college and
          a dashboard to login. COme up with more funtionalities idea. <br>
Step 3.-> Team's superuser can login. Once he log's in he goes to his home.p     
          hp page. This home.php would have editable feature. Front end is crucial here. <br>

Step 4. -> Think of advance and efficient editing. SO that user
          would love editing. <br>
Step 5. ->Decide what all custom fields you want to 
          give for editable home page. <br>
Step 6. ->You may need to deploy some editor and image canvassing. <br><br>


#Coding Practices:
<br>
*All of you have to first go through the given base code stack i.e prtotype.<br>
*Your work should be very small small module based. <br>
*Divide the work among you. <br>
*Every1 should be able to sync with every1's code. <br>
*Every 2nd day code has to be merged to original stack from ur local system.<br>
*Javascript(oop),php(oop),jquery,ajax,socket.io,node,css are must to be grapsed strongly. <br>
*efficiency is must. <br>
*Put images to be lazy loading. Think of some algorithm to implement lazy loading on browser.<br>
<br>
#Database Schema:<br>
Now the app has a simple one table.
Decide the schema for editing and stuffs functionalities.
